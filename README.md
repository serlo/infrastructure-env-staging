# Staging-Infrastructure for Serlo

## Introduction
Serlo's infrastructure is based on Terraform, Kubernetes and the Google Cloud Platform.

Currently we support three different environments:

1. **https://serlo-development.dev** (development environment for new infrastructure code, deployable by all serlo devs - https://github.com/serlo/infrastructure-env-dev)
2. **https://serlo-staging.dev** (staging environment to test and integrate infrastructure and apps, deployable only by infrastructure unit - https://github.com/serlo/infrastructure-env-staging)
3. **https://serlo.org** (production environment, deployable only by infrastructure unit - https://github.com/serlo/infrastructure-env-production)

To get access to our dev/staging environments please contact us.

## Deployment process for staging

The deployment of infrastructure code or new app versions into staging has to be reviewed by the infrastructure unit.

Therefore please open a new **pull request** into main.
